            Even though the FIITJEE Programs speak about JEE (Main & Advanced)
            Coaching, the preparations are given comprehensively for other
            competitive Exams also like NTSE, Olympiads, KVPY and also
            Engineering Entrance Exams like BITSAT etc. FIITJEE's USA UnivQuest

          <li>
            The study material of FIITJEE is pattern-proof i.e. students are
            prepared for JEE (Main & Advanced) irrespective of any type of

    title: <>WWHY CAN'T WE GET DIRECT ADMISSION IN FIITJEE PROGRAMS?</>,
    body: (
      <>
        There are two reasons. One main reason is that FIITJEE's Programs are
        specialty programs that aims at preparing students for coveted entrance
        examinations like JEE (Main & Advanced), Olympiads, KVPY, NTSE, SAT etc.
        Not every student will be able to appreciate the extra load. Moreover,
        by way of admission test, we endeavor to ensure students have sufficient
        base knowledge to appreciate the program. Yes, Success will depend upon
        his hard work, Sincerity, Continuity and support from his parents.
        Secondly, we have limited seats to offer.

        No. It is based on the current patterns of JEE (Main & Advanced),
        Olympiads, KVPY, NTSE, SAT etc. Our admission test is not restricted to
        a particular curriculum. It is designed to check the overall ability of
        the student instead of just command over the subject. The IQ test is
        specifically designed to test a student's potential for JEE (Main &
